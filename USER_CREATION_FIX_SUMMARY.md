# User Creation and Sucursal Assignment - Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. User Creation 500 Error

**Root Cause**: The frontend was sending incorrect data structure to the backend

**Problems Found**:

- Frontend was sending all form fields including `nombre`, `apellido`, `created_at`, `confirmPassword` which don't exist in database
- Form validation was checking all fields instead of just required ones
- Profile image handling wasn't properly converting base64 to BLOB format expected by database
- Backend error handling wasn't detailed enough

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Backend (`usuario_router.py`):

- Added detailed error handling and logging
- Added proper validation for required fields
- Implemented base64 to BLOB conversion for profile images
- Added proper profile image conversion back to base64 when retrieving employee data
- Added exception handling with detailed error messages

#### Frontend (`createUser.jsx`):

- Modified `handleSubmit` to only send database-compatible fields
- Updated `validateForm` to only check required fields
- Added proper data structure for backend API
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

### 2. Sucursal Assignment Issues

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent data structure handling between frontend and backend

**Problems Found**:

- `infoSucursal.jsx` was expecting `employeesData.records` but backend returns array directly
- Sucursal assignment process wasn't using proper relationship management methods

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Backend (`storage_router.py`):

- Updated assignment endpoint to use `add_user_storage_relationship()` method
- Updated removal endpoint to use `remove_user_storage_relationship()` method
- Added proper error handling and validation

#### Frontend (`infoSucursal.jsx`):

- Fixed data structure handling to expect direct array from backend
- Added proper error handling

### 3. Database Method Issues

**Problems Found**:

- `get_storages_by_user()` method wasn't filtering by user_id properly

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Database (`database.py`):

- Rewrote `get_storages_by_user()` method to use proper SQL with WHERE clause
- Added error handling and logging

## Files Modified

### Backend:

1. **`routes/usuario_router.py`**:

   - Enhanced user creation endpoint with better validation and error handling
   - Added proper profile image processing (base64 â†” BLOB conversion)
   - Updated employee retrieval to include storage assignments
   - Added new endpoints for managing employee-storage relationships

2. **`routes/storage_router.py`**:

   - Updated assignment/removal methods to use proper relationship management
   - Added validation and better error handling

3. **`database/database.py`**:
   - Fixed `get_storages_by_user()` method with proper SQL filtering

### Frontend:

1. **`creats/createUser.jsx`**:

   - Fixed data preparation for backend API
   - Updated form validation logic
   - Added proper error handling and logging

2. **`components/infoSucursal.jsx`**:

   - Fixed data structure handling for employee list

3. **`services/employee/employeeService.js`**:

   - Added new functions for storage management

4. **`components/infoEmpleado.jsx`**:
   - Complete rewrite with storage management functionality

## Data Flow Fixes

### User Creation Flow:

1. Frontend collects form data
2. Frontend validates required fields only
3. Frontend prepares clean data object with only database fields
4. Backend validates and processes profile image
5. Backend creates user with proper error handling
6. Frontend assigns selected sucursales to new user
7. Proper success/error feedback to user

### Storage Assignment Flow:

1. Backend uses dedicated relationship management methods
2. Proper duplicate checking and error handling
3. Frontend refreshes data after operations
4. Consistent data structure handling throughout

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test user creation with**:

   - Valid data
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid email format
   - Duplicate username/CUIT
   - With and without profile image
   - With and without selected sucursales

2. **Test storage assignment**:

   - Assign new storage to employee
   - Try to assign duplicate storage
   - Remove storage from employee
   - View employee storage assignments

3. **Test data consistency**:
   - Create user with sucursales
   - Verify assignments in employee info page
   - Verify assignments in sucursal info page
   - Test assignment/removal operations

## Debug Tools Created

1. **`debug_user_creation.py`**: Test script for user creation API
2. **`test_api.bat`**: Curl commands for API testing
3. **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed console logging throughout

The system should now properly:

- Create users with proper validation and error handling
- Assign sucursales during user creation
- Display assigned sucursales in employee info pages
- Allow modification of sucursal assignments
- Handle profile images correctly
- Provide meaningful error messages
