# Employee-Storage Assignment Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: User creation doesn't link with Storage table

**Problem**: When creating a new user, the system wasn't properly linking them to the `usersxstorage` table, so assigned sucursales weren't visible in the employee info page.

**Fix**:

- Updated the backend `storage_router.py` to use the proper `add_user_storage_relationship()` method instead of direct `add_record()`
- This method includes duplicate checking and proper error handling

### Issue 2: Employee info page doesn't show assigned sucursales

**Problem**: The `infoEmpleado.jsx` page only showed basic employee information but didn't display assigned sucursales.

**Fix**:

- Updated the backend `usuario_router.py` endpoint `employee/<user_id>` to include assigned storages
- Fixed the `get_storages_by_user()` method in `database.py` to properly filter by user_id
- Updated the frontend `infoEmpleado.jsx` to display assigned sucursales

### Issue 3: No functionality to change assigned sucursales

**Problem**: There was no way to modify sucursal assignments for existing employees.

**Fix**:

- Added new backend endpoints in `usuario_router.py`:
  - `GET /api/user/employee/<user_id>/storages` - Get employee's storages
  - `POST /api/user/employee/<user_id>/storages` - Assign storage to employee
  - `DELETE /api/user/employee/<user_id>/storages/<storage_id>` - Remove storage from employee
- Added corresponding frontend functions in `employeeService.js`
- Updated `infoEmpleado.jsx` with a complete UI for managing sucursal assignments

## Files Modified

### Backend Files:

1. **`src/backend/routes/usuario_router.py`**

   - Updated `obtener_empleado_by_id()` to include assigned storages
   - Added 3 new endpoints for managing employee-storage relationships

2. **`src/backend/database/database.py`**

   - Fixed `get_storages_by_user()` method to properly filter by user_id
   - Added `# noqa: F401` comment to fix import warning

3. **`src/backend/routes/storage_router.py`**
   - Updated assignment/removal methods to use proper Database relationship methods
   - Added better error handling and validation

### Frontend Files:

1. **`src/renderer/src/services/employee/employeeService.js`**

   - Added `fetchEmployeeStorages()`
   - Added `assignStorageToEmployee()`
   - Added `removeStorageFromEmployee()`

2. **`src/renderer/src/components/infoEmpleado.jsx`**
   - Complete rewrite to show assigned sucursales
   - Added modal interface for assigning new sucursales

   - Added proper loading states and error handling

## New Features Added

### Employee Info Page (`infoEmpleado.jsx`):

- **Displays assigned sucursales**: Shows all sucursales the employee has access to
- **Add sucursales**: Modal dialog to assign new sucursales to the employee
- **Remove sucursales**: One-click removal of sucursal assignments
- **Real-time updates**: Page refreshes data after assignments/removals
- **Loading states**: Proper loading indicators during operations
- **Toast notifications**: Success/error messages for user feedback

### Backend API Endpoints:

- **GET `/api/user/employee/{id}`**: Now includes `assigned_storages` in response
- **GET `/api/user/employee/{id}/storages`**: Get all storages assigned to employee
- **POST `/api/user/employee/{id}/storages`**: Assign storage to employee
- **DELETE `/api/user/employee/{id}/storages/{storage_id}`**: Remove storage from employee

## Database Improvements

- Fixed the `get_storages_by_user()` method to use proper SQL joins with WHERE clause
- Improved error handling in user-storage relationship management
- Better duplicate checking in storage assignments

## User Experience Improvements

- Employees now show their assigned sucursales in the info page
- Administrators can easily modify sucursal assignments without needing to recreate users
- Clear visual feedback for all operations
- Modal interface prevents accidental assignments
- Proper error messages guide users when issues occur

## Testing

Created `test_employee_storage_fix.py` to verify:

- Employee data retrieval includes storage information
- Storage assignment functionality works
- Storage removal functionality works
- All endpoints respond correctly

The fixes ensure that when creating new users, they are properly linked to selected sucursales, and the employee info page now provides full functionality for viewing and managing these assignments.
